WebcamHandler is completly good to go. 

To use:
from WebcamHandler import Webcam Handler
webcam = WebcamHandler()
webcam.start()

While is use:
Until the webcam.is_read() is true, the webcam isn't ready, and is currently capturing the background reference.

the handler has a global variable which sets a requirement for how long the system has to be sure about a gesture before calling it read
in this case, its set to 20. So, it has to read in a gesture 20 times continously before its considered "detected". If there is some disturbance, this resets to "0" (which is noise). 
You can manually reset this count with webcam.reset_detection(). Use this if you want to do the "thumbs up, thumbs down" confirmation idea.

use webcam.get_gesture() to actually grab the gesture.

To stop the handler:
webcam.join()
